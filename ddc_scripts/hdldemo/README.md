Simple code to check status of a file by parsing the handle metadata.

To see the statuts of a file (the handle id is extracted from the file):

python hdldemo.py -f tas_Amon_UKESM1-0-LL_historical_r1i1p1f2_gn_195001-201412.nc

[where the file is a CMIP6 data file which is on the local machine]

OR

python2.7 hdldemo.py -id hdl:21.14100/be06a059-363d-47a4-97a2-d5253190fd15
